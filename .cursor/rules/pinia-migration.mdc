Do not convert store if it implements IEditoitava.

Change VueCompositionApi to vue 3 methods.

Convert store to pinia store setup style.
Remove state const if exists and remove old computed state getters.
If @debounced is present, convert it to lodash debounce.
Do not retain compatibility.
Do not change function names, try to retain old function names.
If store constructor contains stores as parameters, delete these contructor parameters and use parameter store as pinia store.
Only retain constructor parameters which are not stores

If store extends another classs, try to retain functionalities from extended class.

No need to convert these stores:
BrowserStore
